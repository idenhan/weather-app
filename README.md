# weather-app
created this app to know how to work with an API using Javascript.

The app shows the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (26Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country (Seoul, KR).

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from to Fahrenheit.

The icons I used for the app are created by the Graphic Designer Ashley Jager.

The API provider I used is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
